prepare.trans.exp(
  te.df,
  min.transcript.exp = 0.01,
  min.gene.exp = 0.01,
  min.prop = 0.8,
  min.dispersion = 0.1,

}
\arguments{
\item{te.df}{a data.frame with the transcript expression. The first
two columns are the transcript and gene ids, named 'trId' and
'geneId'. The rest of the columns contain the expression values for each sample.}

\item{min.transcript.exp}{the minimum transcript expression. Transcripts
with lower expression in all samples are removed.}

\item{min.gene.exp}{the minimum gene expression. Samples with lower
gene expression are removed from the analysis of this gene. If after this step
the proportion of retained samples for a given gene is smaller than 
\code{min.prop} (see below), the gene is removed from the analysis.}

\item{min.prop}{the minimum proportion of samples with gene expression above
\code{min.gene.exp} for the gene to be analyzed.}

\item{min.dispersion}{the minimum dispersion of the transcript
relative expression. Genes with lower dispersion are removed.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE} the names of filtered genes and transcripts will be displayed. 
Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
a data.frame with the relative transcript expression for the
genes to study.
}
\description{
Prepare the transcript expression matrix. Transcripts with low
expression are removed. Genes expressing only one transcript
are removed because they are not informative for splicing analysis. 
The relative transcript expression is retrieved and genes with
low variability in splicing are removed. Also genes with a small number (<25) of
different splicing patterns are removed as they don't fit the
permutation process.
}
\details{
After removal of inappropriate transcripts/genes, transcript
relative expression is computed by dividing its expression
by the total expression of all transcripts for the gene.
